## Parking Lot

This is a simple parkingLot class; every ParkingLot object has a capacity of 100 cars and keeps track of its own name and how many cars are currently in it.  

A parkingLot object is constructed as empty, but will be given its name. We have mutator methods that enable cars to enter/exit a parkingLot object; remember that we only keep track of how many cars are in a lot. We have an accessor method for the current car count as well as one for the name of the parking lot.  The car count for a parkingLot need to be controlled so that it does not exceed capacity or fall below zero.
